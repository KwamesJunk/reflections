When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I have to work from more than one location/computer
    or if someone else is working on the project too.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Changes might be made public before they're ready. An unusable version
    of the project might be made available as only one part of the intended
    multi-part change might be uploaded.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A fork is GitHub's term for cloning within the GitHub servers. A clone is an
    independent copy of a repository. A branch is within a single repository and
    can later be merged with other branches. I don't know if clones/forks can
    somehow be merged.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    You can work on it offline.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
